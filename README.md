6.005JottoGame
==============

For my last problem set in 6.005 (Elements of Software Construction at MIT) I had to recreate the popular word game Jotto. An explanation of the game can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto. It was group project and I had two other team members. I worked mainly on parsing board files and drawing the graphics. 

The game runs from 6.005JottoGame/ui/JottoGUI.java
