Manual testing for Jotto GUI
============================

Visual Layout of the GUI
	All of the necessary components of the GUI are initialized and appear in the JFrame when the game is started. The top row contains a
	label for the puzzle number, the button to load a new puzzle, and a text field to type in the new puzzle number. The second line contains
	a label for "your guess here" followed by a text field for the user to enter their guess. The next row contains the table for the
	history of the user's guesses. The table is initialized with headers for the columns labeled "guess", "in common", and "correct 
	position". 

Guess Listener
	When the user enters a guess, their guess is immediately entered into the first column of the GUI table. The server's response to 
	their guess is handled by a different class. The text field where their guess is entered clears in preparation for their next guess. 
	
Guess Worker
	When the server responds to the user's guess, the number of letters their guess has in common with the answer is properly entered in
	the second column of the GUI table. The number of letters in the correct position is added to the third column of the GUI table. If
	there is a delay from the server, the correct response is properly delayed and added to the correct column. If the response has not
	been added to the table, and simultaneously, a new puzzle is created, the old response is NOT added to the new game. Errors from the 
	server are properly handled. The user's guess is still put into the first column, and a user friendly response is provided in the 
	second column leaving the third column blank. 
	
New Puzzle Listener
	When there is no puzzle number given, the puzzle listener produces a random number between 1 and 10000 and update the GUI accordingly, 
	just as it should. If there is a puzzle number given, then either pressing enter in the text field or hitting the "new puzzle" button will 
	result in the correct puzzle being loaded. The text field is also reset at this point.
